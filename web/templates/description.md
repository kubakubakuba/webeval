## About

This web application was originally written to allow students to submit [bonus tasks](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b35apo/en/homeworks/bonus/start) for the course [B35APO](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b35apo/en/start),
but to also allow smaller hackathons to be organized.

The application is written in Python, using the Flask framework. Database is running on a PostgreSQL server. The evaluation system is using [QtRvSim](https://github.com/cvut/qtrvsim), which can be used for [interactive solution](https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/qtrvsim/app/) of the tasks.

The code is publicly available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/b35apo/qtrvsim-eval-web).

**New** [Wiki page](/wiki) is available, there you can find all the necessary information about the application. Developer documentation is also available.

**New** You can now view the page in dark mode (automatically detects your OS preset), you can toggle between light/dark mode using the top right toggle. You can also choose your editor theme preference in the profile section of the page.

You can also read more about this application at the [Computer Architectures website](https://comparch.edu.cvut.cz/online-tools/webeval/).

## How to use the application

Create an account, and check the email that has arrived in your inbox (we do not save your email address).
After successfully verifying your email, you can log in and start submitting the available tasks.

If you are logged in, you can see your best (green) and latest (yellow) score, and you can also view the code you submitted.

When you want to submit a task, you can write the code directly in the integrated code editor (from a blank file, or click the reset button to start from a template).

After the evaluation, the result and output log will be displayed at the bottom of the page. If some errors occured, you can view them in the log.
